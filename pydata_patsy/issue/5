It isn't a good idea to have this line here, because then if you use pip or easy_install to install patsy, it will try to upgrade numpy under some circumstances. This is rude and should never happen automatically. In my case, I had 1.8.0-dev on my system (in-place build) and pip tried to ignore it and install 1.7.0 into site-packages.\n\nThe same was done for statsmodels. There it was replaced with\n\n     try:\n         from numpy.version import short_version as npversion\n     except ImportError:\n         raise ImportError(\"statsmodels requires numpy\")\n\n", issueState = "open", issueId = 6313136, issueComments = 2, issueMilestone = Nothing}
