That can't be the full solution though; it will for sure break when you're using virtualenvs that you manage with PYTHONPATH (as in what Fernando suggested: http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2012-May/062382.html).\n\nBesides that, my solution does specify the dependency. It just doesn't automatically install it. Which is a bad idea in any case, for several reasons:\n- a large fraction of users won't have the correct compilers installed, so it won't work with pip. they're better off downloading a binary.\n- if they use easy_install instead of pip, they may get slow no-SSE NumPy binaries from PyPi.\n- They may have an older numpy version installed that they don't want to or can't upgrade, and it gets upgraded anyway (this doesn't actually happen with patsy, but it does with pandas).\n- Unexpected compilation starts eating all memory, forcing me to close my browser (actually true :( ).\n- ... (I'm sure I can find some more)\n\nYou're right though that I don't feel like opening bugs on half the packages that depend on numpy. Perhaps we should recommend this on numpy-dev. For numpy/scipy and any package which is nontrivial to compile.", issueCommentId = 7877923}
