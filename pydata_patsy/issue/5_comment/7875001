That said, we all know that python packaging tools have tons of fundamental designs bugs and we do have to workaround bugs when necessary... but I'm a little wary of this \"solution\".\n\nDo you still have this problem if you run 'python setupegg.py egg_info' in your in-place numpy build, so that pip can see that you have a numpy install?", issueCommentId = 7875001}
