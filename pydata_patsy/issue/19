When you make interactions between predictors, you get things like:\r\n\r\nC(trimcod, Treatment(4))[T.3]:C(flota, Treatment(11))[T.10]\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to assign an alias or just forget all the stuff apart from the predictor name to get something like:\r\n\r\n[trimcod][T.3]\r\n\r\nor just [trimcod 3]\r\n\r\nI've playng with the MyTreat example but I can't get any positive results\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n\r\nJorge Tornero", issueState = "open", issueId = 14718313, issueComments = 6, issueMilestone = Nothing}
