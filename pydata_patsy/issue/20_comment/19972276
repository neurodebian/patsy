B/c that can\r\nproduce orthogonalized columns? The people I know are always excited about\r\ntesting for whether the higher order terms are significant, and that's most\r\neasily done if you use orthogonalized columns as your polynomial basis. (Of\r\ncourse this requires we implement poly() but that's not hard, just, no-one\r\nhas gotten around to it.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jun 25, 2013 at 1:22 PM, Skipper Seabold\r\n<notifications@github.com>wrote:\r\n\r\n> Yeah I was thinking of *.
