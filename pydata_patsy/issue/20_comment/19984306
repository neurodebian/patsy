Orthogonal\r\npolynomials are ones where if you evaluate them at every point in their\r\ndomain, the resulting vectors are orthogonal. For regression, we want\r\npolynomials such that if you evaluate them at every point where there is\r\ndata, then the resulting vectors are orthogonal.\r\n\r\nThere's already code for doing this using qr in the patsy Poly class for\r\ncategorical polynomial coding, but it hasn't been adapted to be a numerical\r\nstateful transform.\r\nOn 25 Jun 2013 16:01, \"Skipper Seabold\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Translation of Stata's orthpoly.ado, so likely not fit for inclusion\r\n> anywhere, but I'll leave it here. // cc @josef-pkt<https://github.com/josef-pkt>\r\n>\r\n> https://gist.github.com/jseabold/5859121\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/pydata/patsy/issues/20#issuecomment-19982092>\r\n> .\r\n>", issueCommentId = 19984306}
