At least, I couldn't figure out how to replicate what `orthpoly` gives with `Poly` for a continuous regressor, but I just wanted to work on something else for an hour.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand your distinction between what's orthogonal to what. I think `orthpoly` is like a scaled version of legvander that Josef was after.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom statsmodels.tools.tools import webuse\r\ndta = webuse(\"auto\")\r\nweight = dta[\"weight\"].values.astype(float)\r\north = orthpoly(weight, 4)\r\nnp.allclose(np.dot(orth[:,0], orth[:,1]), 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stata.com/help11.cgi?orthpoly", issueCommentId = 19985792}
