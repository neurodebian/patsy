The idea is to be able to pass an additional parameter to Treatment, say display_name that overrides, if provided, the default name for Transform, i.e., [T.1] to whatever you want. It looks very nice, but I don't know how to separate the \"very first part' from the \"Treatment\" part. I guessed that it should be contained somewhere in the .design_info variables, but I haven't been able to find it. Any suggestions to proceed?\r\n\r\nI see that modifying the source is somehow a step further and more dangerous that implement the recipe for MyTreat in the documentation, but I haven't been able to make that sort of constructions, sorry.\r\n\r\nThank you very much\r\n\r\nJorge Tornero\r\n\r\n", issueCommentId = 18537053}
