A coding class like `Treatment` gets to set the `[T.1]` part to be whatever it wants. You can easily do that with a custom class like `MyTreat` too, though, the built-in classes like `Treatment` just use the same APIs that you can use yourself in a custom class. You don't have to separate the \"very first part\" from the `[T.1]` part, because you can only affect the `[T.1]` part. The rest comes from the factor's `.name` (https://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/expert-model-specification.html#patsy.factor_protocol.name). The `.design_info` variables don't have anything to do with this AFAICT; that's just where patsy puts the names after it has figured them out, to pass them back to the user.", issueCommentId = 19221469}
