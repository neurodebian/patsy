What I wanted to mean is concerned to the names that appear int statsmodels.GLMResults.summary(). Those names are the names I referred in my first message, sort of \r\n\r\nC(trimcod, Treatment(4))[T.3]:C(flota, Treatment(11))[T.10]\r\n\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\nThat's why I asked for simpler names. AFAIK those names are stored in desig_info.column_names but they're not modifyable by user, BUT if you get pandas DataFrames instead of designmatrices as output for patsy.dmatrices(), you are able to tweak those names replacing text in the DataFrame column list for what you want.\r\n\r\nSo what I am asking for is:\r\n\r\nA way to make possible to rename the output column names to whatever you want; maybe something like a design_info.setColumnNames for both desingmatrices output or dataframe output. Or just and additional parameter in patsy.dmatrix and/or patsy.dmatrices to provide a list of column names, say so, display names.\r\n\r\nThe issue about tratment is because it is a nice way to, at least, provide nicer names for some part of the final column names in the dmatrices/dmatrix output. Maybe an option in dmatrices /dmatrix like columns_names_from treatment=True could do the trick also.\r\n\r\nI provide you with a little example... with three or four interactions, the GLMResults.summary gets a little confusing:\r\n\r\nC(trimcod, Treatment(4))[T.3]:C(flota, Treatment(11))[T.10]:C(flota, Treatment(6))[T.11] \r\n\r\nWhe the relevant information is that the term is formed by the interaction of \r\n\r\ntrimcod 3, flota 11 and flota 6\r\n\r\nI hope I have explained myself better this time. Sorry for the inconveniences.\r\n\r\nJorge Tornero\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", issueCommentId = 19528903}
