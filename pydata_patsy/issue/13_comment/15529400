This affects at least `C`, `Q`, and `I`, which I think is all of our single-variable names for now...\r\n\r\nSee here: http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.2/gotchas.html#symbols (specifically \"Lastly, it is recommended that you not use I, E, S, N, C, O, or Q for variable or symbol names...\").\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a mess, because of course we want people to be able to use sympy and patsy together.\r\n\r\nI suppose we could still rename `Q` to, like, `V` or something (for \"variable\"), but `C` and `I` have 20 years of tradition behind them, so I'm really not sure what the best solution is here :-/.", issueCommentId = 15529400}
